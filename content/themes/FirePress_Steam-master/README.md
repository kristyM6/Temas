# FirePress_Steam


## What is this?

This theme is a free and responsive theme (*template if you prefer*) made for Ghost. This theme is compatible with Ghost `>= 2.0.0`. You can check this information in the file `package.json`.

**What is Ghost?** — Ghost is an open source software that lets you create a website and manage content like a blog. [See our FAQ section](https://firepress.org/en/faq/#what-is-ghost) for more details.

<br>


## Live Demo

[play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/) is a playground to learn about Ghost. What's remarkable here, is that you have the option to log in into the admin panel of each live demo available, by using dummy credentials.

In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

**Bonus** — The live demo sites feature a post named **Style guide**. It gives you the big picture of how this theme renders elements like titles, quotes, paragraphs, button tables, etc.

## Why fork this Ghost Theme?

- **Enhancements** — This theme has been enhanced to feature some elements that are not present in the original theme. IMHO, these elements are hard to live without.
    1) Buttons
    2) Icons (Font Awesome)
    3) Code Syntax (highlight.js)
    4) Grid table (great to make pricing table)
- **Drop-in replacement** — No special tweaks to do. It will work out of the box. Ensure to use the appropriate [Code Injection](https://firepress.org/en/what-is-code-injection-in-ghost/) snippet.
- **Code Injection** — We share snippets that customize the look of this theme. See [git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Code-Injection-for-Ghost-themes). It’s an easy way to customize this theme. This allows you to override pretty much any styles you want to change.
- **Curated** — This theme was carefully selected out of hundreds of Ghost themes. See more of them in our [Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection ](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go) repo, or [by tags on Github](https://github.com/topics/firepress-ghost-theme).
